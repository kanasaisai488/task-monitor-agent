# main.py â€“ Agentic Project Monitor CLI

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
Watches a quant project folder for file changes and triggers the TaskMonitorAgent pipeline.

## ðŸš€ Usage
```bash
python main.py --watch-folder "G:/My Drive/QUANT_TOOLS/my_alpha_strategy"
```

## ðŸ§  Tip
You can integrate this into the Makefile:
```bash
make watch
```
â€¦ and dynamically select a folder each time.

## ðŸ“‚ Recommendation
- Keep `main.py` at project root
- Use `Makefile` to simplify CLI use
- Extend this watcher to include auto diff, prompt, commit pipeline hooks
